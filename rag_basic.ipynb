Much depends on the skill, training and attitudes of the \\npersonnel involved. Quality Assurance is particularly important, and this type of \\nmanufacture must strictly follow carefully established and validated methods of \\npreparation and procedure. Sole reliance for sterility or other quality aspects \\nmust not be placed on any terminal process or finished product test. \\n \\nNote: This guidance does not lay down detailed methods for determining the \\nmicrobiological and particulate cleanliness of air, surfaces , etc. \\nReference should be made to other documents such as the EN/ISO \\nStandards. \\n \\n \\nGENERAL'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='microbiological and particulate cleanliness of air, surfaces , etc. \\nReference should be made to other documents such as the EN/ISO \\nStandards. \\n \\n \\nGENERAL \\n \\n1. The manufacture of sterile products should be carried out in clean areas entry \\nto which should be through airlocks for personnel and/or for equipment and \\nmaterials. Clean areas should be maintained to an appropriate cleanliness \\nstandard and supplied with air w hich has passed through filters of an \\nappropriate efficiency. \\n \\n2. The various operations of component preparation, product preparation and \\nfilling should be carried out in separate areas within the clean area. \\nManufacturing operations are divided into two categories; firstly those where the \\nproduct is terminally sterilised, and secondly those which are conducted \\naseptically at some or all stages. \\n \\n3.

Clean areas for the manufacture of sterile products are classified according to \\nthe required characteristics  of the environment. Each manufacturing operation \\nrequires an appropriate environmental cleanliness level in the operational state \\nin order to minimise the risks of particulate or microbial contamination of the \\nproduct or materials being handled. \\n \\nIn order  to meet “in operation” conditions these areas should be designed to \\nreach certain specified air -cleanliness levels in the “at rest” occupancy state. \\nThe “at rest” state is the condition where the installation is installed and \\noperating, complete with production equipment but with no operating personnel \\npresent.

Normally such \\nconditions are provided by a laminar air flow work station. Laminar air flow \\nsystems should provide a homogeneous air speed in a range of 0.36 – 0.54 m/s \\n(guidance value) at the working position in open clean room applications. The \\nmaintenance of laminarity should be demonstrated and validated. \\nA uni-directional air flow and lower velocities may be used in closed iso lators \\nand glove boxes. \\n \\nGrade B:  For aseptic preparation and filling, this is the background \\nenvironment for the grade A zone.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='and glove boxes. \\n \\nGrade B:  For aseptic preparation and filling, this is the background \\nenvironment for the grade A zone. \\n \\nGrade C and D :  Clean areas for carrying out less critical stages in the \\nmanufacture of sterile products \\n \\n \\nCLEAN ROOM AND CLEAN AIR DEVICE CLASSIFICATION \\n \\n4. Clean rooms and clean air devices should be classified in accordance with EN \\nISO 14644-1. Classification should be clearly differentiated from operational \\nprocess environmental monitoring.

It is commonly understood tha t risk is defined as the  combination of the \\nprobability of occurrence of harm and the severity of that harm. However, \\nachieving a shared understanding of the application of risk management among \\ndiverse stakeholders is difficult because each stakeholder mi ght perceive \\ndifferent potential harms, place a  different probability on each harm occurring \\nand attribute different severities to each  harm. In relation to pharmaceuticals, \\nalthough there are a variety of stakeholders,  including patients and medical \\npractitioners as well as government and industry, the  protection of the patient \\nby managing the risk to quality should be considered of prime importance. \\n \\n9.

Quality risk management is a systematic process for the assessment, control,  \\ncommunication and review of risks to the quality of the drug (medicinal) product  \\nacross the product lifecycle. A model for quality risk management is outlined in \\nthe diagram (Figure 1). Other models could be used.

Risk assessment consists of the identification of hazards and the analysis and  \\nevaluation of risks associated with exposure to those hazards (as defined \\nbelow). Quality risk assessments begin with a well -defined problem description \\nor risk question. When the risk in question is well defined, an appropriate risk \\nmanagement tool (see examples in section 5) and the types of information \\nneeded to address the risk  question will be more readily identifiable. As an aid \\nto clearly defining t he risk(s) for  risk assessment purposes, three fundamental \\nquestions are often helpful: \\n \\n1. What might go wrong? \\n2. What is the likelihood (probability) it will go wrong? \\n3. What are the consequences (severity)? \\n \\n Risk identification is a systematic use of informat ion to identify hazards \\nreferring to  the risk question or problem description.

It is  the qualitative or quantitative process of linking the likelihood of \\noccurrence and severity of harms. In some risk management tools, the ability to \\ndetect the harm (detectability) also factors in the estimation of risk. \\n \\n23.

The o utput of a risk assessment is either a quantitative estimate of risk or a \\nqualitative description of a range of risk. When risk is expressed quantitatively, \\na numerical  probability is used. Alternatively, risk can be expressed using \\nqualitative descriptors , such as “high”, “medium”, or “low”, which should be \\ndefined in as much detail as  possible. Sometimes a \"risk score\" is used to \\nfurther define descriptors in risk ranking.

The intermediate steps within  a scoring \\nprocess can sometimes employ quantitative risk estimation. \\n \\n Risk Control \\n \\n26. Risk control includes decision making to reduce and/or accept risks. The \\npurpose of risk control is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The amount \\nof effort used for  risk control should be proportional to the significance of the \\nrisk. Decision makers  might use different processes, including benefit -cost \\nanalysis, for understanding the optimal level of risk control. \\n \\n27.

Risk reduction focuses on processes for mitigation or avoidance of quality risk \\nwhen it exceeds a specified (acceptable) level (see Fig. 1). Risk reduction might \\ninclude actions taken to mitigate the severity and probability of harm. Processes \\nthat improve the detectability of hazards and quality risks might also be used as \\npart of a risk  control strategy.

Risk acceptance is a decision to accept risk. Risk acce ptance can be a formal \\ndecision to accept the residual risk or it can be a passive decision in which \\nresidual risks are not specified. For some types of harms, even the best quality \\nrisk management practices  might not entirely eliminate risk. In these \\ncircumstances, it might be agreed that an  appropriate quality risk management \\nstrategy has been applied and that quality risk is  reduced to a specified \\n(acceptable) level.

Quality risk management supports a scientific and practical approach to \\ndecision-making. It provides documented, transparent and reproducible \\nmethods to accomplish steps of the quality risk management process based on \\ncurrent knowledge about  assessing the probability, severity and sometimes \\ndetectability of the risk.  \\n \\n34. Traditionally, risks to quality have been assessed and managed in a variety of \\ninformal ways (empirical and/ or internal procedures) based on, for example, \\ncompilation of  observations, trends and other information. Such approaches'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='informal ways (empirical and/ or internal procedures) based on, for example, \\ncompilation of  observations, trends and other information. Such approaches \\ncontinue to provide  useful information that might support topics such as \\nhandling of complaints, quality defects, deviations and allocation of resources.  \\n \\n35. Additionally, the pharmaceutical industry and regulators can assess and \\nmanage risk  using recognized risk management tools and/ or internal \\nprocedures (e.g., standard  operating procedures). Below is a  non-exhaustive \\nlist of some of these tools (further details in Annex 1 and Chapter 8): \\n\\uf0b7 Basic risk management facilitation methods (flowcharts, check sheets \\netc.)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='Annex 20   Quality Risk Management \\n \\n \\nPE 009-14 (Annexes) -164- 1 July 2018 \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) \\n\\uf0b7 Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) \\n\\uf0b7 Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) \\n\\uf0b7 Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) \\n\\uf0b7 Hazard Operability Analysis (HAZOP) \\n\\uf0b7 Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) \\n\\uf0b7 Risk ranking and filtering \\n\\uf0b7 Supporting statistical tools \\n \\n36.

The references are included as an aid to gain more \\nknowledge and detail about the particular tool. This is not an exhaustive list. It is \\nimportant to note that no one tool or set of tools is applicable to every situation \\nin which a quality risk management procedure is used. \\n \\nI.1 Basic Risk Management Facilitation Methods \\n \\nSome of the simple techniques that are commonly used to structure risk  \\nmanagement by organizing data and facilitating decision-making are: \\n\\uf0b7 Flowcharts \\n\\uf0b7 Check Sheets \\n\\uf0b7 Process Mapping \\n\\uf0b7 Cause and Effect Diagrams (also called a n Ishikawa diagram or fish \\nbone diagram) \\n \\nI.2 Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='\\uf0b7 Flowcharts \\n\\uf0b7 Check Sheets \\n\\uf0b7 Process Mapping \\n\\uf0b7 Cause and Effect Diagrams (also called a n Ishikawa diagram or fish \\nbone diagram) \\n \\nI.2 Failure Mode Effects Analysis (FMEA) \\n \\nFMEA (see IEC 60812) provides for an evaluation of potential failure modes for \\nprocesses and their likely effect on outcomes and/or product performance.   \\nOnce failure modes are established, risk redu ction can be used to eliminate, \\ncontain, reduce or control the potential failures. FMEA relies  on product and  \\nprocess understanding. FMEA methodically breaks down the analysis of  \\ncomplex processes into manageable steps. It is a powerful tool for summarizing \\nthe important modes of failure, factors causing these failures and  the likely \\neffects of these failures. \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nFMEA can be used to prioritize risks and mo nitor the effectiveness of risk \\ncontrol activities. \\n \\nFMEA can be applied to equipment and facilities and might be used to analyze'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='FMEA can be used to prioritize risks and mo nitor the effectiveness of risk \\ncontrol activities. \\n \\nFMEA can be applied to equipment and facilities and might be used to analyze  \\na manufacturing operation and its effect o n product or process. It identifies  \\nelements/operations within the system that render it vulnerable. The output/  \\nresults of FMEA can be used as a basis for design or further analysis or to  \\nguide resource deployment. \\n \\nI.3 Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) \\n \\nFMEA might be extended to incorporate an  investigation of the degree of \\nseverity of the consequences, their respective probabilities of occurrence, and  \\ntheir detectability, thereby becoming a Failure Mode Effect and Criticality  \\nAnalysis (FMECA; see IEC 60812). In order for such an analysis to be  \\nperformed, the product or process specifications should be established. \\n \\nFMECA can identify places where additio nal preventive actions might be \\nappropriate to minimize risks.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='Annex 20   Quality Risk Management \\n \\n \\nPE 009-14 (Annexes) -169- 1 July 2018 \\n \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nFMECA application in the pharmaceutical industry should mostly be utilized  for \\nfailures and risks associated with manufacturing processes; however, it is  not \\nlimited to this application. The output of an FMECA is a relative risk  “score” for \\neach failure mode, which is used to rank the modes on a relative risk basis. \\n \\nI.4 Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) \\n \\nThe FTA tool (see IEC 61025) is an approach that assumes failure of the  \\nfunctionality of a product or process. This tool evaluates system (or subsystem)  \\nfailures one at a time but can combine multiple causes of failure by  identifying \\ncausal chains. The results are represented pictorially in the form of  a tree of \\nfault modes. At each level in the tree, combinations of fault modes are  \\ndescribed with logical operators (AND, OR, etc.). FTA relies on the experts’  \\nprocess understanding to identify causal factors.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='described with logical operators (AND, OR, etc.). FTA relies on the experts’  \\nprocess understanding to identify causal factors. \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nFTA can be used to establish the pathway to the root cause of the failure. FTA  \\ncan be used to investigate complaints or devi ations in order to fully understand  \\ntheir root cause and to ensure that intended improvements will fully resolve the  \\nissue and not lead to other issues (i.e. solve one problem yet cause a different  \\nproblem). Fault Tree Analysis is an effective tool for eva luating how multiple  \\nfactors affect a given issue. The output of an FTA includes a visual  \\nrepresentation of failure modes. It is useful both for risk assessment and in  \\ndeveloping monitoring programs. \\n \\nI.5 Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) \\n \\nHACCP is a systematic, proactive, and preventive tool for assuring product  \\nquality, reliability, and safety (see WHO Technical Report Series No 908,  2003'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='HACCP is a systematic, proactive, and preventive tool for assuring product  \\nquality, reliability, and safety (see WHO Technical Report Series No 908,  2003 \\nAnnex 7). It is a structured approach that applies technical and scientific  \\nprinciples to analyze, e valuate, prevent, and control the risk or adverse  \\nconsequence(s) of hazard(s) due to the design, development, production, and  \\nuse of products. \\n \\nHACCP consists of the following seven steps: \\n \\n1. conduct a hazard analysis and identify preve ntive measures for eac h \\nstep of the process; \\n2. determine the critical control points; \\n3. establish critical limits; \\n4. establish a system to monitor the critical control points; \\n5. establish the corrective action to be taken  when monitoring indicates that \\nthe critical control points are not in a state of control; \\n6. establish system to verify that the HACCP system is working effectively; \\n7. establish a record-keeping system.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='Annex 20   Quality Risk Management \\n \\n \\nPE 009-14 (Annexes) -170- 1 July 2018 \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nHACCP might be used to identify and manage risks associated with physical,  \\nchemical and biological hazards (including microbiological contamination).  \\nHACCP is most useful when product and proces s understanding is sufficiently \\ncomprehensive to support identification of critical control points. The output of  a \\nHACCP analysis is risk management information that facilitates monitoring  of \\ncritical points not only in the manufacturing process but also in other life  cycle \\nphases. \\n \\nI.6 Hazard Operability Analysis (HAZOP) \\n \\nHAZOP (see IEC 61882) is based on a theory that assumes that risk events are \\ncaused by deviations from the design or operating intentions. It is a systematic  \\nbrainstorming technique for identifying hazards using so -called “guide-words”. \\n“Guide-words” (e.g., No, More, Other Than, Part of, etc.) are applied to  relevant'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='brainstorming technique for identifying hazards using so -called “guide-words”. \\n“Guide-words” (e.g., No, More, Other Than, Part of, etc.) are applied to  relevant \\nparameters (e.g.,  contamination, temperature) to help identify  potential \\ndeviations from normal use or design intentions. It often uses a team  of people \\nwith expertise covering the design of the process or product and its application. \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nHAZOP can be applied to manufacturing processes, including outsourced  \\nproduction and formulation as well as the upstream suppliers, equipment and  \\nfacilities for drug substances and drug (medicinal) products. It has also been  \\nused primarily in the pharmaceutical indu stry for evaluating process safety  \\nhazards. As is the case with HACCP, the output of a HAZOP analysis is a list of \\ncritical operations for risk management. This facilitates regular monitoring  of \\ncritical points in the manufacturing process. \\n \\nI.7 Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA)'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='critical operations for risk management. This facilitates regular monitoring  of \\ncritical points in the manufacturing process. \\n \\nI.7 Preliminary Hazard Analysis (PHA) \\n \\nPHA is a tool of analysis based on applying prior experience or knowledge of a  \\nhazard or failure to identify future hazards, hazardous situations and events that \\nmight cause harm, as well as to estimate their probability of occurre nce for a \\ngiven activity, facility, product or system. The tool consists of: 1) the  \\nidentification of the possibilities that the risk event happens, 2) the qualitative  \\nevaluation of the extent of possible injury or damage to health that could result  \\nand 3)  a relative ranking of the hazard using a combination of severity and  \\nlikelihood of occurrence, and 4) the identification of possible remedial  \\nmeasures. \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nPHA might be useful when analyzing existing systems or prioritizing hazards'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='likelihood of occurrence, and 4) the identification of possible remedial  \\nmeasures. \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nPHA might be useful when analyzing existing systems or prioritizing hazards  \\nwhere circumstances prevent a more extensive technique from being used. It  \\ncan be used for product, process and facility design as well as to evaluate the  \\ntypes of hazards for the general product type, then the product class, and finally \\nthe specific product. PHA is most commonly used early in the development of a \\nproject when there is little information on design details or  operating \\nprocedures; thus, it will often be a precursor to further studies.  Typically,'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='Annex 20   Quality Risk Management \\n \\n \\nPE 009-14 (Annexes) -171- 1 July 2018 \\n \\nhazards identified in the PHA are further ass essed with other risk management \\ntools such as those in this section. \\n \\nI.8 Risk Ranking and Filtering \\n \\nRisk ranking and filtering is a tool for co mparing and ranking risks. Risk ranking \\nof complex systems typically requires evaluation of multiple diverse  quantitative \\nand qualitative factors for each risk. The tool involves breaking  down a basic \\nrisk question into as many components as needed to capture factors involved in \\nthe risk. These factors are combined into a single relative  risk score that can \\nthen be used for ranking risks. “Filters,” in the form of  weighting factors or cut -\\noffs for risk scores, can be used to scale or fit the risk  ranking to management \\nor policy objectives. \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nRisk ranking and filtering can be used to prior itize manufacturing sites for'), Document(metadata={'source': 'PICS'}, page_content='or policy objectives. \\n \\nPotential Areas of Use(s) \\n \\nRisk ranking and filtering can be used to prior itize manufacturing sites for  \\ninspection/audit by regulators or industry. Risk ranking methods are  particularly \\nhelpful in situations in which the portfolio of risks and the  underlying \\nconsequences to be managed are diverse and difficult to compare  using a  \\nsingle tool. Risk ranking is useful when management needs to evaluate  both \\nquantitatively-assessed and qualitatively -assessed risks within the same  \\norganizational framework. \\n \\nI.9 Supporting Statistical Tools \\n \\nStatistical tools can support and facilitate q uality risk management. They can  \\nenable effective data assessment, aid in determining the significance of the  \\ndata set(s), and facilitate more reliable decision making.
